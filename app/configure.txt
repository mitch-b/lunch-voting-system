Thank you for your interest in the installation
of the lunch voting system (tm)(r).

1.  INSTALLATION
===========================

Typical installation of Lunch Voting System uses
MySQL database. Other than that, ensure your web
host has PHP 5.3+ installed. Drop the associated
files in your web-hosted folder, and you're good
to go.


2.  CONFIGURATION
===========================

Once your MySQL database is configured, you'll
need to add an administrator user account. This
should be added to installation script and will
be good to go.

User maintenance should be self-service, and
will email out to administrators for new account
registration approvals.

This system depends on being able to send mail
from PHP. Please be sure this is configured for
proper workflow to execute.

If an entry in restaurant table is inserted with 
a password of 'oursecret' (md5 hashed), then that 
restaurant is the "override" choice regardless 
of what was voted by other users.

2.1 CRON CONFIGURATION
===========================

This application relies heavily on cron to update
itself every week. You'll want 4 different cron
schedules set for this application. The first
is to randomize lunch selections for the week by
overwriting index.php with a generated file from
the perl script. The second will email users to
vote before it closes. The third will
close voting polls, and email all registered
users the results. The fourth will simply reset
the pages so that new users will just see a simple
message instead of poll results.
